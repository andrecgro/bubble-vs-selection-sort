# Animated Bubble and Selection Sort Iteration

Project proposed by the Professor Ednaldo Pizzolato, who was giving a Lecture called "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" at the University of SÃ£o Carlos

## The Idea

The main idea for this project was to build an animated step by step solution, in any programming language, that allow us to compare two different algorithms that solves the same problem, to be short:
 - Animated iteraction step by step
 - The project should allow us to compare both solutions
 - Didatics approach, to learn and help others learn with this project
 
## The Solution
 
We developed a solution that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to apply Bubble and Selection Sort to the same vector and iterates animating the algorithm step by step.
The vector to be ordened, could be:

  - Given vector ( fill the input text and click the first button )
  - Random vecotr ( just click the second button )
  
  *It should be an integer's vector*
